# Our Addendum

## Resolving multiple spans

In case on multiple annotation going from label the relation annotation.

E.g. for the case:

> The man was happy

The man | was | happy

There is no need to label teh relations

but for 
> The man was happy and sad

The man | was | happy
The man | was | sad

You will have to label the first relation and the seconds such that they can be distinguished.

## No object

In case there is no object, you can just label the subject and the relation.

E.g.

> He exploded

He | exploded

## Annotating time and location
Annotating it as a relation to the the relation/verb

Note that time refers to the time the relation takes place!
